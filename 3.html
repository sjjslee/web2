  <h2>JavaScript</h2>
JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəˌskrɪpt/),[8] often abbreviated as JS, is a high-level, interpreted 
programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. JavaScript has 
curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.

Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web.[9] 
JavaScript enables interactive web pages and is an essential part of web applications. 
The vast majority of websites use it,[10] and major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript 
engine to execute it.

As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven, functional, and imperative 
(including object-oriented and prototype-based) programming styles. It has APIs for working 
with text, arrays, dates, regular expressions, and the DOM, but the language itself does not 
include any I/O, such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities. It relies upon the host 
environment in which it is embedded to provide these features.
